Thought Note 

i started creating this assignment with the (header) component 
in which first i import the font-awesome and bootstrap for the desing and icons for navbar 

Header Structure: The header is wrapped in a <header> tag with a main container <div id="header">.
Hamburger Menu: Uses Bootstrap for a responsive navigation bar with a toggle button. This is displayed on smaller screens.

Navigation Links: Includes navigation links for "Home", "Contact", "All Products", and dropdown menus for "Women", "Men", and "Kids" categories.

then similarly created the footer component using pure css and html syntax

then created the Home cover part in which there is just an image for home screen and added the css accordingly.

then created the ProductCard Component:  
 used Props for The component  that accepts three props: image, title, and description.
image: URL of the product image.
title: Title of the product.
description: Description of the product.

then in last there is a ProductCarousel Component :

in which first i created An array products is defined to store product data. It contains two sub-arrays (representing slides) with objects that have image, title, and description properties for each product.

used useRef hook,  carouselRef = useRef(null): and Creates a reference to access the DOM element of the carousel.

useEffect hook :  for Initializing the Bootstrap carousel when the component mounts.
Adds event listeners to the previous and next buttons to allow manual navigation through the carousel slides.
Cleans up event listeners when the component unmounts.
